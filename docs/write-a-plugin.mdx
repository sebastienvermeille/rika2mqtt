# Write a plugin for RIKA2MQTT

> API for plugins is currently under development and is marked `@Beta`. Be cautious that it can have breaking changes between future releases.

RIKA2MQTT provide an API for plugin creators.

A few modules in the project are demonstrating plugins:

* rika2mqtt-example-plugin
* rika2mqtt-example-plugin-using-config

And an official plugin `rika2mqtt-flux-metrics-plugin` that exports RIKA stove status to InfluxDB.


More documentation will follow in the future when the API is more stable and heavily tested.
