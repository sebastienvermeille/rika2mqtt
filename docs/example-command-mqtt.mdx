# Control RIKA stove via MQTT

You can send commands to your stove via MQTT. This opens a lot of possibilities for your IoT system, NodeRed, ...

<Info>By default Rika2Mqtt will listen for commands sent in topic: {{ config.defaultCommandTopicName }}.</Info>


Here are some example of commands that can be sent to your RIKA stove via MQTT using Rika2Mqtt.

## Update target temperature via MQTT

Publish an MQTT message to `{{ config.defaultCommandTopicName }}` with the following JSON payload:

```json
"stoveId": "your stove id",
"targetTemperature": 20
```

<Info>To retrieve your stove id, simply go to rika-firenet and display your stove.
    Then you can retrieve the stove id from the url of the browser:
    `https://rika-firenet.com/web/stove/&lt;your stove id&gt;`
</Info>


And voila! Rika2Mqtt will automatically do the necessary to forward this change to Rika-Firenet that will then forward it to your Rika stove.
