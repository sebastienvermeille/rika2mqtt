## What is it ?
Rika2Mqtt is a Bridge to let you take control and monitor your RIKA firenet stove through MQTT.

It will publish regularly the status of your RIKA stove to MQTT, so you can display the status to your IoT platform or store some metrics such as in a Grafana Dashboard up to you!

You can even send commands to your stove via MQTT, let's drive your stove the way you want :)
