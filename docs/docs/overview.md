## What is it ?

RIKA2MQTT is a free and opensource bridge enabling end-users to connect their RIKA firenet stove to an MQTT server.


It will publish regularly the status of your RIKA stove to MQTT, so you can display the status to your IoT platform or store some metrics such as in a Grafana Dashboard up to you!

You can even send commands to your stove via MQTT, let's drive your stove the way you want :)
